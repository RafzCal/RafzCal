- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RafzCal or Rafael Calmon.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python with udemy courses.

I started learning coding in 2021 together with my college in Chemical Engineering, is being little complicade to choose a language to study,
so i decided to star with python. 

I intend in this beginning post some challenges that i will do to show my apprenticeship in this language.
